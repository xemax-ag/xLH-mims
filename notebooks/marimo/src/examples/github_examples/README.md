  <em>A curated collection of example <a href="https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo">marimo</a> notebooks.</em>
</p>

This repository contains a curated collection of example
[marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) notebooks. Use these notebooks
as starting points for your own data exploration, experimentation, workflows,
and apps.

## Running examples

Each example has a README that tells you how to run it locally. Most examples
can also be opened in marimo's [online
playground](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/publishing/playground/) by clicking
the "open in marimo" badge in its README.

## Adding new examples

We welcome community contributions of examples!

Open a pull request to contribute a new example. Ideally, examples are easy for
others to adapt to their own data and models. Here's a contribution checklist:

- [ ] Place the example in its own folder
- [ ] Include package dependencies in notebook files [using
  `--sandbox`](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/package_reproducibility/)
- [ ] Include a short README.md describing your example and how to run it.
- [ ] Include instructions on how to adapt the notebook to custom data and models

If you aren't comfortable adding a new example, you can also request new
examples by filing an issue.
